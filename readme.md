# Problems on Arrays in C Language

This repository contains a collection of problems related to arrays in C language. Each problem is a standalone C program that can be compiled and run on its own.

The problems cover a range of topics, including:

* Basic array operations (e.g. finding the maximum or minimum element, reversing an array)
* Array manipulation (e.g. inserting or deleting elements, shifting elements)
* Searching and sorting arrays
* Using arrays to solve real-world problems (e.g. finding the frequency of elements, calculating the sum of elements)

Each problem is accompanied by a README file that contains a description of the problem, as well as any relevant instructions or constraints.

The solutions to the problems are provided in separate files, labeled as "solution.c". These files contain the complete source code for the solution, and can be compiled and run on their own.

The problems are organized into folders, with each folder representing a single problem. The folder name is a brief description of the problem, and the contents of the folder include the problem description, the solution code, and any relevant input or output files.

The repository is designed to be a useful resource for anyone looking to practice their skills in C programming, particularly with regards to working with arrays. The problems are designed to be challenging, yet accessible, and are intended to help users improve their understanding of the language and its capabilities.
